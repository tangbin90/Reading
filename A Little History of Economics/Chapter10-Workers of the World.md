>A [[Spectre]] is haunting Europe – the spectre of communism.

>He had incredible [[Stamina]], but also a tendency to put things off and get into a [[Muddle]].

>He’d often take [[Refuge]] in the British Museum Reading Room, where he devoured difficult books on history and economics.

>I hope the [[Bourgeoisie]] will remember my [[Carbuncles]] until their dying day.

**Karl Marx (1818–83)**  
_The Communist Manifesto_

> The history of all [[Hitherto]] existing society is the history of class struggles

> Marx believed that capitalism itself contained the seeds of a new society. He said that history unfolds in a series of economic systems. Before capitalism, the economy was governed by feudal traditions.

## Labour Theory of Value
>Marx said that the value of a good is the amount of labour used to make it. This is known as the ‘labour theory of value’.

> ‘Surplus value’ goes to the capitalist as profit. The surplus allows capitalists to buy more machines and capital and this makes the economy get bigger. Capitalists ‘exploit’ the workers in the sense that they want to squeeze out as much surplus value as possible by making them work hard and long. 

## [[Bourgeoisie]] and [[Proletariat]]
>The workers rise up, seize the factories and fields and set up a communist society, which ends exploitation. That’s because there’d be no private property: a furnace or crane wouldn’t be owned by a particular capitalist, it would be owned by the community. People would be given what they needed to live rather than what a capitalist boss paid them. Communism would get rid of the division of society into different classes constantly fighting against each other.

## Opposition
>Critics also say that the failures of actual communist societies prove Marx was wrong. However, his theory was more to do with the tensions of capitalism than with the details of the communist future. Also, Marx said that societies would only successfully establish communist systems once they had well-developed capitalist economies.

## Alienation
>He believed that under capitalism, workers become cogs in a giant machine. They lose any real connection to the goods they make that their bosses sell for a profit. Only by getting rid of private property through a workers’ revolution will people be able to fully embrace their humanity.

>The Communist Manifesto ends with a call to arms: ‘The [[Proletariat]] have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working men of all countries, unite!’
