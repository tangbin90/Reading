**The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money**

# Saven Economy from Recession
> Keynes had argued that to avoid a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s, governments needed to intervene in their economies.

Follower: Kennedy/Lyndon Johoson

## Why
According to Keynes, recessions happen when savings don’t get invested in factories and machines. When people save rather than spend and businesspeople stop investing, there’s less spending overall and the economy stops growing.

## How
### Fiscal Policy
* Budget deficit
> If the government pours enough of its own spending into the bath it can offset the spending flowing out as savings. In fact, what the government does is to borrow the unspent savings that are sloshing around the economy and spend them itself; it redirects them back into the bath.

The Keynesians
**Cut taxes – Kennedy’s policy**
> The spending effect is called the ‘multiplier’: the eventual impact on the economy is a multiple of the original spending boost or tax cut.

### Monetary Policy
The simplest type is the government printing more dollars.
A lower interest rate stimulates business investment. That means more spending in the economy and so higher national income and more jobs.

Money(No Interest)<->Bond(Interest)

The Flow
> higher money supply -> lower interest rates -> higher investment -> higher national income and employment

## Phillips Curve
> There was a curve linking the two extremes: a bit less unemployment came with a bit more inflation
# Opponent
> Perhaps too much government spending was causing economies to become more unstable by pushing up inflation.
