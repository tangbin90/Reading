John Maynard Keynes(1883-1946)
**The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money**
Background: The Great Depression

# Why Rich Countries Go Bust
>  No one was doing anything ‘wrong’, but for some reason the economy as a whole could go wrong. It could stutter and then completely stall, all by itself.

# Conventional Economics
- about how to use scarce resources
- the income of a nation is simply how much can be produced by its factories and workers.
- factories run at full capacity and that every worker is employed. It’s because the economy produces as much as it’s able to that resources are scarce

# Keynes Theory
- The income
>  the income of a country income is the amount that people spend, what they ‘demand'.

- [The bath model] (https://docs.qq.com/flowchart/DQkVEWkJlcWRyWGJl)
> why assume that extra savings automatically turn into investment in new factory buildings and machines? The hose isn’t attached to the tap leading back into the bath. It leads into a drain and the savings disappear down it

- once the economy is in recession it has no means of escape
> Whenever you save five shillings, you put a man out of work for a day
