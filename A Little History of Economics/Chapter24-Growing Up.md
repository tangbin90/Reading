## Rich Country and Poor Country
Rich countries are those with a lot of capital compared to the population. That means they’re able to produce a lot of output for each person. It’s output per person that’s the proper measure of how rich a society is. A society of ten people that produces goods worth £100 is twice as rich as a society of twenty producing the same amount.

## Diminishing Returns to Capital
Imagine a country that has only a few bread ovens. Investing in an extra one adds a lot to bakers’ production. As more ovens are installed, though, it becomes harder to find people to run them, so the hundredth oven adds a much smaller amount to production than the tenth one did.

## Conclusion
Living standards in poor countries tend to catch up with those of rich countries, just as a small child eventually gets closer in height to its older sibling.

## Technology
Technological progress allows more to be made with the capital and labour that a country has.

Paul Romer (b. 1955) started off a new wave of growth theory which treated technology as ‘endogenous’ – produced within the economy. 

Big economies – ones that are good at creating new ideas – can keep on getting bigger without slowing down. The smaller ones won’t automatically catch up.
