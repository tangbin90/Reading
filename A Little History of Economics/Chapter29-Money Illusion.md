## Monetarism
Friedman brought money back to the center of economics and his school of thought became known as ['monetarism’](https://docs.qq.com/flowchart/DQnBGSmtvVWxldkdq).

The problem is that workers have confused ‘money’ wages with ‘real’ wages. Economists call it ‘money illusion’. Once workers realize their mistake, they stop working as much and the economy returns to its original, lower level of employment. The only effect is that inflation is higher.

### National Income
National Income = Velocity * Money
> If the central bank of Pineapple Island prints five more $1 bills, then the money supply doubles to $10. With a velocity of circulation of two, each of the ten $1 bills changes hands twice, generating $20-worth of transactions. National income has doubled.
Friedman, however, believed that the velocity of money was fairly stable, and therefore that money does influence national income.

## Explanation of Recession
> In his view, after the war governments had got addicted to boosting the economy and pushed up inflation. During the 1930s, it was the opposite problem. America’s central bank created the century’s worst recession – the Great Depression – by pumping too little money into the economy.

## What should Government do
> The best thing is for the government to commit to a fixed rate of growth in the money supply, say 3 per cent a year, in line with the growth of the economy.

### Supply-side Economics

The route to that was to enhance the economy’s supply (what its businesses were able to produce), not its demand.
