**Hyman Minsky (1919–96)**
## Background
> These events, thousands of miles apart, were connected by a breakdown in the world’s financial system, which after 2007 made the entire global economy tumble over. 
The Global Financial Crisis, the Credit Crunch, the Great Recession 
## The Make of Investment
**Keynes**
> Investment therefore depends on people feeling optimistic – Keynes called it their animal spirits – rather than on a favourable mathematical calculation of the probability of profits in the future. When people’s animal spirits dampen down, investment falls and the economy sags.

**Minsky**
> Money, and the banks that help create investment by making loans, are what power the economy – and what eventually lead it into a crisis.

## Daring Capitalism
> Cautious capitalism gives way to daring capitalism: more people want to borrow, and banks want to lend to them because it makes them a profit.
Which leads to the Speculative Lending
> the loans are a bet that house prices won’t fall and that interest rates won’t rise, so borrowers won’t get into trouble with their loans.

## Ponzi Finance
> Lenders and borrowers were creating a self-fulfilling upwards spiral, what economists sometimes call a bubble. Minsky called the reckless system of lending ‘Ponzi finance’

### Securitization

> Housing loans were used to make securities that could be bought and sold. The securities were a financial cocktail of different loans. Whoever bought a security received the loan repayments from the owners of the houses. However, many of the loans were ‘subprime’ loans: ones made to people who were at a high risk of not being able to repay them.

Bank wont know the people who pay for the securities they bought. So with information loss, risk emerge from the darkness.

### Austerity
> During recessions, governments’ deficits – the gap between their spending and their revenue – typically rise because when people and businesses earn less, the amount of tax collected goes down.

## Conclusion
> The financial crisis and the recession that followed weren’t exactly the result of greedy borrowers or bankers. The deeper reason was to do with the effects of finance-based capitalism.

>  Capitalism became more reckless as the centers of banking – New York’s Wall Street and the City of London – helped to fuel growth with fancy financial products.

> Capitalism evolves from its cautious form into its reckless one.
