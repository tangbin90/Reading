George Akerlof(b. 1940)
In the economy some people know more than others.
## Conventional Economy Model
Markets had to be competitive and they couldn’t suffer from externalities such as a factory’s pollutant imposing costs on a nearby fishery.

## Information Economics
In the economy some people know more than others.
### Insurance Case
> Again, it’s a failure of the market because you’d like to have full insurance coverage, and the firm would like to sell it to you, but a lack of information stops the trade.

### Adverse Selection
Adverse selection happens when important characteristics are unknown by buyers or sellers.

## Signals
Michael Spence (b. 1943), investigated how people get round lack of information by ‘signaling’ to each other.
> For example, firms want to hire the most productive people, but people’s ability is hard to observe. One way that people signal their ability is by obtaining educational qualifications.
But education does not make people that much better at their jobs.

## Information Economics in IMF and TWB
Joseph Stiglitz (b. 1943) 

> Conventional economics, to the extent that it championed free markets above all, was simply wrong.
> They completely ignored the risks of free-market policies that let money flow in and out of countries without any restrictions when the lenders didn’t have good information about who they were lending to.

## Why Wages are Not Falling During Recession
> An employer can’t watch its workers all the time and so doesn’t know how hard they’re working. To encourage them to work hard, the employer increases the wages it pays. When all employers do the same the overall wage level increases. At a high wage level, firms hire fewer workers and unemployment rises.

## Conclusion
> On receiving his Nobel Prize, Stiglitz suggested that the reason that the hand is invisible is that it’s not there – and if it is, it’s paralyzed.
