**1. Social Media Shifts People Toward Performance Over Connecting**
But gradually, social-media users became more comfortable sharing intimate details of their lives with strangers and corporations. As I wrote in [a 2019 _Atlantic_ article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/social-media-democracy/600763/) with Tobias Rose-Stockwell, they became more adept at putting on performances and managing their personal brand—activities that might impress others but that do not deepen friendships in the way that a private phone conversation will.

**2. Social Media’s Innovations (i.e., Likes, Share, and Retweet) Increase Division**
Shortly after its “Like” button began to produce data about what best “engaged” its users, Facebook developed algorithms to bring each user the content most likely to generate a “like” or some other interaction, eventually including the “share” as well. Later research showed that [posts that trigger emotions](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1618923114)––especially [anger at out-groups](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2024292118)––are the most likely to be shared.

**3. Social Media Weakens Trust**
It’s not just the waste of time and scarce attention that matters; it’s the [continual chipping-away of trust](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/collapsing-levels-trust-are-devastating-america/616581/). An autocracy can deploy propaganda or use fear to motivate the behaviors it desires, but a democracy depends on widely internalized acceptance of the legitimacy of rules, norms, and institutions. Blind and irrevocable trust in any particular individual or organization is never warranted. But when citizens lose trust in elected leaders, health authorities, the courts, the police, universities, and the integrity of elections, then every decision becomes contested; every election becomes a life-and-death struggle to save the country from the other side.
**4. Social Media Encourages Division**

First, the dart guns of social media give more power to trolls and provocateurs while silencing good citizens. Even a small number of jerks were able to dominate discussion forums, Bor and Petersen found, because nonjerks are easily turned off from online discussions of politics.

Second, the dart guns of social media give more power and voice to the political extremes while reducing the power and voice of the moderate majority.  The one furthest to the right, known as the “devoted conservatives,” comprised 6 percent of the U.S. population. The group furthest to the left, the “progressive activists,” comprised 8 percent of the population. The progressive activists were by far the most prolific group on social media: 70 percent had shared political content over the previous year. The devoted conservatives followed, at 56 percent.
Those who express sympathy for the views of opposing groups may experience backlash from their own cohort.” In other words, political extremists don’t just shoot darts at their enemies; they spend a lot of their ammunition targeting dissenters or nuanced thinkers on their own team. 

Finally, by giving everyone a dart gun, social media deputizes everyone to administer justice with no due process. Platforms like Twitter devolve into the Wild West, with no accountability for vigilantes. A successful attack attracts a barrage of likes and follow-on strikes. Enhanced-virality platforms thereby facilitate massive collective punishment for small or imagined offenses, with real-world consequences, including [innocent people losing their jobs](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/stop-firing-innocent/613615/) and being [shamed into suicide](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-suicide-by-facebook-shaming-1.5366184). When our public square is governed by mob dynamics unrestrained by due process, we don’t get justice and inclusion; we get a society that ignores context, proportionality, mercy, and truth.



**5. Social Media Facilitates Confirmation Bias**

_The most pervasive obstacle to good thinking is [confirmation bias](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/09/cognitive-bias/565775/), which refers to the human tendency to search only for evidence that confirms our preferred beliefs. Even before the advent of social media, search engines were [supercharging](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/301367349.pdf) confirmation bias, making it far easier for people to find evidence for absurd beliefs and conspiracy theories, such as that the Earth is flat and that the U.S. government staged the 9/11 attacks. But social media made things much worse._

**6. Social Media Weakens Institutions**

The stupefying process plays out differently on the right and the left because their activist wings subscribe to different narratives with different sacred values. The “Hidden Tribes” study tells us that the “devoted conservatives” score highest on beliefs related to authoritarianism. They share a narrative in which America is eternally under threat from enemies outside and subversives within; they see life as a battle between patriots and traitors. According to the political scientist Karen Stenner, whose work the “Hidden Tribes” study drew upon, they are psychologically different from the larger group of “traditional conservatives” (19 percent of the population), who emphasize order, decorum, and slow rather than radical change.

Only within the devoted conservatives’ narratives do Donald Trump’s speeches make sense, from his campaign’s ominous opening diatribe about Mexican “rapists” to his warning on January 6, 2021: “If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”

#### Hope After Babel
Yet when we look away from our dysfunctional federal government, disconnect from social media, and talk with our neighbors directly, things seem more hopeful. Most Americans in the More in Common report are members of the “exhausted majority,” which is tired of the fighting and is willing to listen to the other side and compromise. Most Americans now see that social media is having a negative impact on the country, and are becoming more aware of its damaging effects on children.
