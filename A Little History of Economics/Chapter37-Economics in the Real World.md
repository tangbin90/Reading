## Design an Auction
>  Auction theory draws on the tools of game theory and information economics.
>  Designing auctions is about solving problems of strategy and information to make sure that the bidder with the highest valuation wins, and that the seller maximizes profit.

### Ascending Auction, Descending Auction and Sealed Bid
> An auctioneer stands behind a Ming vase and shouts out a price, inviting bidders to offer increasing prices until there’s only one bidder left

> The auctioneer starts at a high price and then lowers it until someone offers to buy.

> Each bidder submits a bid in a sealed envelope. The person with the highest bid pays the amount that they bid and gets the house. 

## How to make people bid the valuation? 

William Vickrey (1914–96)
>  Vickrey proposed a ‘second-price’ auction in which the winning bidder is the highest bidder but pays an amount equal to the second-highest bid. 

## Bid the Phone License
 Paul Klemperer (b. 1956)
>  But the government had several licenses to sell, so they were sold at the same time in repeated rounds of bidding.
>  In the UK auction bidders weren’t allowed to bid for more than one license.(Avoid signal to each other )

## End
> Roth and Klemperer started off as engineers, later turned to economics and helped turn economic principles into powerful tools for designing the real-world economy not only for broad questions
