# Time Inconsistency
what’s best today is no longer what’s best tomorrow.
Kydland and Prescott discovered that rational expectations led to time inconsistency.

## Effect
> The Keynesian economic policy followed in the 1950s and 1960s was based on the idea that the government could affect the path of the economy by adjusting how much it spent. 

> The rational expectation theorists said that this was impossible. If the government boosts the economy, rational people normally foresee that higher wages will get eaten up by higher prices.(我预判的你的预判)

So the result will be
> They won’t take on more employment. The only effect of the government’s policy is to push up inflation.

# Solution
## Take Advantage of Short-term Effect
> Although the government can’t normally influence employment, it sometimes can in the immediate future if it suddenly boosts the economy without people expecting it. In May it tries to do so, hoping to gain politically from a lower level of unemployment.

## Policy [[Discretion]]
![Rule or Discretion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LjQbpIoLp8)
>The government doesn’t fail because it’s crooked or stupid; rather, its freedom to decide at every point in time leads it into self-defeating actions. But how can the government enforce it? It holds the levers of power and so will always break its own rule. The problem is that the more power it has, the less it seems to have. 


## Independent Central Bank
> A solution to the problem of time inconsistency is for the government to give up its power over the central bank. Make the central bank independent, so the argument goes, and monetary policy will no longer be in danger of manipulation by politicians.
> It would be like the lenient teacher sending the lazy student to the office of a strict head teacher who everyone knows enjoys giving out detentions.>)

In September 2020 the Fed codified its new views by promising not to raise interest rates at all until employment had already reached its maximum sustainable level.
