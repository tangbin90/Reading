>Population will quickly [[Outstrip]] food supply. There’ll soon be too many mouths [[Gobbling]] up too little food.

>They had to eat scraps and trudge through mud for hours to get anywhere.

_An Essay on the principle of population, as it affects the future improvement of society with remarks on the speculations of Mr. Godwin, M. Condorcet, and other writers_

## Population
### Mercantilists
> They believed that large populations helped nations to win out over foreign rivals because a large labour force working for low wages allowed manufacturers to make cheap goods to sell abroad, and a large army and navy made possible the defense of the nations’ trade routes”

### Utopian thinkers
> People weren’t doomed to poverty. They believed above all in progress. If people helped each other, poverty and squalor could be abolished

### Malthus
>Malthus feared an ever-growing population: more people meant more poverty, he claimed. All that a growing population would do was to condemn more and more people to a [[Wretched]] existence.

Two starting points
>First, humans need food to survive. Second, they must have sex in order to reproduce. What’s more, they like having sex and will keep doing it.
