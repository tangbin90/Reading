>But as you eat more [[Toffees]] the pleasure you get from an extra one won’t be as great. The tenth toffee is nice, but not as nice as the first.

## Why Champagne Valuable
>Adam Smith and Karl Marx thought that value came from the costs of producing something, especially in the labour that went into making it.

Another reason:
>It’s valuable because people like it a lot. Champagne gives them a great amount of satisfaction or happiness.

## Marginal Utility
**[William Jevons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Jevons) (1835–82)**
> The pleasure from an extra toffee is its marginal utility. ‘Margin’ means the edge of something, so the ‘edge’ of your utility from toffees is the utility of the very last one you ate. The tendency of marginal utility to go down as you consume more is known as the ‘principle of diminishing marginal utility’.

## The Law of Demand
**Alfred Marshall (1842–1924)**
>Marshall combined the consumer and the firm in the theory of supply and demand, one of the most famous ideas in economics. A ‘demand curve’ links price with the quantity that people want. 

>A firm produces another spoon if the extra revenue from selling it (marginal revenue) is higher than the cost of making it (marginal cost). As it produces more spoons it gets costlier to produce an extra one.

## Perfect Competition
>No single buyer or seller can alter the price. Economists call it ‘perfect competition’. No one makes huge profits because competition keeps prices down. Consumers get what they want at low prices.

## Rational Economic Man
>To Marx capitalism was all about the exploitation of workers by capitalists. Workers create the economic value, but capitalists take most of it as profit. In the world of ‘rational economic man’ there are simply lots of people buying and selling things. There’s no such thing as exploitation

## End
>Marshall’s economics became known as ‘neoclassical’ economics: it was an updated version of the ‘classical’ economics of Smith and Ricardo. Classical economics was about how markets power the economy and make it prosper. Neoclassical economics was about how rational individuals power those markets. It abandoned the search for an ultimate measure of value like labour or gold. Value was simply the price of something that came from supply and demand. A rare bottle of wine costs a lot because there is limited supply and lots of demand.

>Have economists ever met any real people, critics ask? All theories have to simplify, the question is how far to go. As we’ll see later, even some economists thought that ‘rational economic man’ was a step too far.
