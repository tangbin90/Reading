## Soviet economy problems

> Under communism, people’s earnings aren’t tied to what they do because they’re all given the same income, so who’d ever bother to clear out the pigsties?

> Communism makes people behave differently than under capitalism: in a communist society, people would be obedient and unselfish, dedicated to hard work not for their own sake, but for that of the nation.

## Ludwig von Mises' grenade/ɡrəˈneɪd/
> He believed that communist economies like that of the Soviet Union were doomed to failure even if every last person would joyfully clean the nation’s toilets for a pittance if ordered to by the government.

- Prices allocate resources to their most profitable uses: the production of the goods that people most want.
- Under central planning all this has to be worked out by the government. (Stalin: ‘The paperwork you are throwing at me is piling up to my chest!’ )
- Price cant be set by orders, The reason for the Soviet Union’s economic problems was that the system of socialism itself was irrational.

## Oskar Lange & Abba Lerner
An economy needed the measuring stick of prices, but they thought that central planners would be able to make their own sticks and then manage the economy in a rational way. All that planners had to do was to solve a mathematical problem. 

## End
Mises said, capitalism is the only rational economic system.
