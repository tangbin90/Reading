Background: The Cold War
__Game Theory__
Arm race is a typical example.
__Prisoners' Dilemma__


**John Vonda Neumann(1903-5)**
Von Neumann took a big step by working out a method for finding the outcome of games. But it only worked for some kinds, such as those in which participants were able to negotiate and make firm agreements with each other.

But in reality, the players wouldn’t necessarily stick to any promises they made to each other.

**John Nash(1928-2015)**
Nash Equilibrium
Both of us building up our stock of missiles is the equilibrium of the game of arm race.

The outcome of a game – its ‘equilibrium’ – is that in which each player does the best for himself given what the other player does. When everyone’s doing that, no one has any reason to change what they’re doing, so that’s the equilibrium of the game.
