**Charles Fourier**: a system of harmony
> He imagined people living in small communities called ‘phalansteries’. The phalanstery would be a rectangular building containing workshops, libraries, even an opera house. 

> It would be a place where you’d be able to **follow your passions to the full**

**Robert Owen**: A New View of Society
>People were bad because they came from bad conditions. If you wanted a good society you had to establish the right conditions. In an environment free of the cut-throat competition of capitalism, the poor could become good, happy people. Owen had a plan for creating the perfect environment.

**Saint-Simon**: The New Christianity
>Saint-Simon thought that society should be ruled by talented people, not by princes and dukes. Everyone should allow their fellow humans to flourish and to develop as best they can. There’d be differences between people, but because of differences in abilities, not differences of birth. No longer would people exploit each other. Instead they’d exploit nature together, using scientific principles to enrich society.
