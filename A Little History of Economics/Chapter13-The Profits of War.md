>Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (1870–1924) was [[Tucked]] away in a remote [[Lodge]] in the Tatra mountains in Poland.

>It was the latest in a series of [[Exiles]] from his native country which took him across Europe, [[Dodging]] police and government agents and using false names and fake passports. 

>Lenin slipped back into Russia in [[Disguise]].

>They [[Stage#Verb|Staged]] [[Uprisings]] and [[Rebellions]] and eventually won back political control of their countries.

**Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (1870–1924)**
>To Lenin, war meant the ruling classes of opposing nations sending working men to kill each other, men who should instead stand united against their true common enemy – the capitalist bosses of Europe

## Three Big Trends
- There was a greater volume of trade between countries, and investors were putting more of their money into businesses in foreign countries.
- Now large banks were financing large corporations. Lenin called it ‘monopoly capitalism’, monopolies being large firms controlling entire markets.
- Then there was the trend of imperialism: European nations taking control of foreign territories to create empires that extended around the world.
## Conventional Points
- the conventional view of imperialism was that it was a heroic [[Endeavour]], an outlet for the adventurous spirit and bravery of great leaders.
- imperialist nations brought civilisation to poor countries, which would drag the peoples of Africa and Asia into the modern world. 

**John Hobson (1858–1940)**
he was a heretic – a rebel against orthodox thinking
_Confessions of an Economic Heretic_
>Hobson and Lenin said that under monopoly capitalism more of the economy’s income goes to a few rich and powerful financiers. That means that more of the country’s income is saved rather than consumed. 

>Imperialism is caused by greed, then, and the armies of imperial countries are used to crush local populations to help capitalists get richer, said Hobson. As rival capitalist nations seek new markets, they get in each other’s way, hence the jostling for territory as the nineteenth century came to a close, and the outbreak of the First World War a few years later.

>The idea helped to resolve the puzzle of why capitalism hadn’t collapsed when Marx had predicted that it would. The reason was that it had been given new life by imperialist expansion.

[[My Country Right or Left]]

```ad-note
This remind me of the ratical socialist thoughts of Gorge Owell's essays _My Country Right or Left_
```

**Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (1870–1924)**
_Imperialism(/ɪmˈpɪr.i.ə.lɪ.zəm/): The Highest Stage of Capitalism_
>Marx had fumed at capitalism and private property for leading to the exploitation of the workers. Now Lenin added another complaint. Capitalism and private property had made war inevitable. His solution was radical: ‘Convert the imperialist war into a civil war.’

## Another Sound
>The flow of British money to foreign countries wasn’t because capitalists were fleeing a sinking economy in which they couldn’t sell their goods – it was because the economy was doing so well. New technologies created wealth that entrepreneurs were able to invest around the world. 

>And although wars and colonialism(/kəˈloʊ.ni.ə.lɪ.zəm/) are surely bound up with economics – in struggles over trade and raw materials – they’re also connected to other desires, such as those for power and status.
