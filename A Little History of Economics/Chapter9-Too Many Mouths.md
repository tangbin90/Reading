_An Essay on the principle of population, as it affects the future improvement of society with remarks on the speculations of Mr. Godwin, M. Condorcet, and other writers_

## Population
### Mercantilists
> They believed that large populations helped nations to win out over foreign rivals because a large labour force working for low wages allowed manufacturers to make cheap goods to sell abroad, and a large army and navy made possible the defense of the nations’ trade routes”

### Utopian thinkers
> People weren’t doomed to poverty. They believed above all in progress. If people helped each other, poverty and squalor could be abolished
