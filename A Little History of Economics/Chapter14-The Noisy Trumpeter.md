Arthur Cecil Pigou (1877–1959)

**‘welfare economics’** It examines the overall benefit to society that comes from all the decisions made.

This is part of **‘normative economics’** the branch of economics that allows you to judge an economic situation, here whether a market is performing well or badly.

## Side Effects
- **The Neighbor's Trumpet and Your Headache**
>Markets often lead people to make choices that benefit them but have damaging side-effects on others.  In making the judgement we’re thinking about what’s best for society as a whole, not just for one person.
- **The Paint Factory and The Fishery**
>Thinking about society as a whole – the factory and the fishery together – it would be better if those extra tins of paint weren’t produced.  From the point of view of society as a whole, markets lead to ‘too much’ paint being produced.
- **Packaging Company Inventions**
>The benefit to society as a whole of the packaging company’s research into new plastics might well be much greater than the extra profit earned by the company. But when deciding how much to spend on research the company doesn’t take account of the broader social benefits, those positive effects on other companies.**Now markets lead to ‘too little’ of something of benefit to society.**

## The Externalities
>Externalities have effects on people or firms other than – or ‘external to’ – those who created them.

>Pigou showed that market failures arise when there’s a difference between ‘social’ effects (the overall impacts on everyone) and ‘private’ effects (ones that affect only the person producing the externality).

> Pigou said that the government then needs to give markets a push in the right direction. It should encourage ‘positive’ externalities and discourage ‘negative’ ones.

## The Monopolist
>The monopolist tends to push up the price to increase profits; the higher price means consumers buy less and so the firm produces less. In a competitive market with lots of firms a greater amount of goods get made and sold at a lower price. This is why most economists think that competitive markets are better for society than monopolies.

>‘Antitrust’ policies by governments try to make markets more competitive by banning the creation of monopolies or splitting them up into smaller companies. 

## Conclusion
>Pigou’s work showed some of the policies that could be used to improve the workings of specific markets – those for paint, fish, oil and so on. Today, economists still use his theories to think about how governments can use taxes and subsidies to help make better use of society’s resources.
