## Why Be an Economists
Economists lose touch with reality? Economics has had its successes, like the **Find kidney donors system**
## Deal with global warming
### Global Warming is an Externality
The damage caused by a company's activities for which it does not pay.
> William Nordhaus (b. 1941) considers the emission of carbon dioxide a special type of externality because it extends over space and time. 

> German emissions affect farmers in China and Brazil. It spans generations because carbon dioxide emitted today will heat the planet for many decades to come.

### Reduce Emissions at a Lower Cost  
> **Tax on carbon**
Gov could get people to reduce their emissions by putting a tax on carbon. The idea is to make the costs of carbon have a greater influence on people’s economic decisions.

> **Carbon trading permits**
A firm that would find it hard to cut its emissions can buy a permit from a firm that could cut back more easily. As with a tax, polluters who can cheaply reduce their emissions cut back the most. 

## Big questions and Narrow Questions
How human societies as a whole work. Do societies progress better with free markets and competition, or by people getting together and cooperating? What exact role should financial markets play in the growth of the economy?

Simple economic principles can cover those question or foresee the crisis.
Economists failed to use theories of free market and rationality to redesign entries societies

### Criticism
> Some people think they’re not really ‘science’ at all. They say that underneath economists’ equations is a conservative political ideal that says that free markets, competition and individual effort are what matter above all else.

### Why
Question remains: Why we study economics.
> Thinkers looked at the economy in many different ways and held all sorts of political beliefs. Some were diehard supporters of capitalism, some wanted to fix it, some to destroy it. What tends to get left out of basic economics courses is the ideas of rebellious thinkers like Thorstein Veblen, Karl Marx and Friedrich Hayek, and even of the more accepted ones like Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes.


> By appreciating the different responses of history’s thinkers we can be inspired to come up with our own, the new ideas we need in order to face today’s economic problems.


## The Starting Point
> What does it take to live well in a human society? What do people need to be happy and fulfilled? What makes them truly thrive? That’s where economics started and, after all the arguments and disagreements, it’s where it must begin from again.
