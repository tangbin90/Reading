## The food Price Issue
>Some people thought that high food prices were caused by the high rents earned by landowners, which pushed up farmers’ costs. Ricardo disagreed, claiming that it was the other way round: high food prices caused high rents. 

### Solution
what would happen if the Corn Laws were removed?
Cheap foreign grain would flood in. Workers wouldn’t have to struggle with high food prices. Capitalists would have a lower wage bill, because their workers wouldn’t need to spend so much on food.

## Comparative Advantage
**opportunity cost**
> Britain has a comparative advantage in iron and Russia in grain, then Britain should just make iron and import its grain from Russia, and Russia should just grow grain and import its iron from Britain. The idea is profound because every country has a comparative advantage in something and so every nation has the potential to gain by specializing and trading. It’s better for countries to open their borders to foreign trade than to try to be self-sufficient. Although a few economists have challenged it (see Chapter 12), Ricardo’s idea of comparative advantage became one of the most cherished principles of economists.

Will work in the certain range. Don't think the global trade will lead to common wealth

## Ricardo a land owner
Ricardo had become a landlord. But his position didn’t stop him from arguing tirelessly for free trade – something that would threaten the wealth he had earned from his own land, but which his principles of economics had shown to be right.
