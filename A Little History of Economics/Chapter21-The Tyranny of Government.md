Friedrich Hayek(1899-1992)
__The Road to Serfdom__
## Nazism And War-time Economy
Government control of the economy helped to do that. Many people felt that the government should continue to play a big part in the economy once the fighting was over, and by the 1940s economists had come to the conclusion that governments had an important role, war or no war

## Free The Economy
> The postwar economy was a ‘mixed’ economy, a middle way between capitalism and socialism. The government owned big industries like coal and the railways, controlled the prices of some goods and paid for schools and hospitals, giving the economy a socialist flavour. But a strong capitalist tang remained: there was a large number of privately owned firms ruled by profit. Hayek rejected the compromise. He said that state control of the economy would deprive people of their freedom, even under the middle way of the mixed economy.
> People have different desires and disagree about which ones are most important. If the government takes control of the economy it ends up deciding for you. You’re no longer able to choose and your personal freedom gets trampled on.

## Consequence
> In an economy controlled by the state, if you do your work badly you don’t lose your own money but that of the nation as a whole. The entire community pays for your mistakes. You must pay by going to prison or, in an extreme case, with your life. What begins as an attempt to get rid of the unfairness of capitalism ends in tyranny.

## Another Sound
Most economists today disagree with Hayek’s basic position that more government means less freedom. When the government provides schooling for every child, surely it increases people’s freedom? When people can read and write they can participate fully in society – they can get good jobs and understand the policies of the leaders who they vote for.
