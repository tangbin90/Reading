God: By the sweat of your brow will you eat your food.  
Jesus Warn: People could love cloths jewels and money more than God

## The City of God
**St Augustine of Hippo (354–430)**
> At the top of which sits Christ, the savior of humanity. The City of God was governed by human laws as well as God’s laws. That was because people had to take part in the ordinary, everyday activity of making money. Wealth was a gift from God to sinful people who needed it to survive. The best life would be had by giving up possessions, which some Christians did by living without money as hermits or in communities of monks.

## Feudalism
>Rulers needed warriors to hold back hordes of horseback invaders. It was expensive to maintain warriors, so kings gave them land in return for their loyalty. The warriors promised to fight for the king when he needed them. 

## God’s economy
>God’s economy on earth was arranged as a ‘chain of being’. 

>At the top was God and Christ; their representatives on earth were first the pope and then the kings who gave land to the great lords, and at the bottom were the peasants who worked the land. The peasants would hand over crops to the lord, keeping some for themselves.

**Thomas Aquinas(1224/25–1274)**
## Beehive Theory
>Aquinas pictured the chain of being as a beehive, with the bees’ roles given by God: some gather honey, some build the walls of the hive, others serve the queen bee. The human economy was like this. Some people work the land, some people pray and others fight for the king. The important thing was not to be greedy and not to envy other people’s money.

>It was fine to sell something for profit as long as the money was put to good use, said Aquinas; if someone had more money than they needed then they had to give some to the poor. 

## Make of Usury
**usury**: the activity of lending someone money with the agreement that they will pay back a very much larger amount of money.
> The medieval churchmen said that lending money for interest was stealing because money was ‘barren’: it was infertile, and so couldn’t reproduce.

## Aquinas View of nterest
>Aquinas said that interest on loans was in fact sometimes acceptable. It was fine for lenders to charge it to make up for the profits they had to give up when they lent out their money. Gradually the churchmen came to see that there was a difference between usury – high interest rates that ruin the borrower – and reasonable rates that were needed for banks to work.

## The Fall of God's Economy
>In 1253 an Italian firm began its handwritten accounts with the words ‘In the name of God and of profit’. God’s economy was merging with the new world of commerce.
