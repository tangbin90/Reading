**Guewara and Castro**
## Pionts
Guevara and Castro believed that the poverty in Cuba, and in the other countries of Latin America, was caused by the greed of rich countries, especially the United States. They said that rich countries ‘exploited’ the poor ones. 
**HOW?**
## Way Out
> The people had to seize power and set up a socialist system that ends exploitation. 

**Andre Gunder Frank (1929-2005)**
**The Development of Underdevelopment**
## Reason
> Profits from the export of goods from poor countries – things like bananas and coffee – don’t go into real economic development such as new schools or industries. Poor countries’ economies are dominated by big foreign companies.

## Dependency Theory
World capitalism divides into two. At the centre of the system is a ‘core’ of rich countries in Europe and North America. At the edge of the system – on its ‘periphery’ – are the poor countries of Latin America, Asia and Africa. The core wins at the expense of the periphery.

periphery/pəˈrɪf.ɚ.i/:the outer edge of an area:

**Raúl Prebisch (1901–86)**
## Conventional Points
**David Ricardo**(comparative advantage)
> If nations specialise in the production of goods that they’re relatively better at making (in other words, in their comparative advantage) and trade with other nations, then all nations are made better off.

## Prebisch Points
> Poor countries like Cuba tended to export ‘primary’ products such as sugar, coffee and bananas. Rich countries tended to export manufactured products like television sets and cars. When people get richer they spend more on television sets and cars but they don’t spend nearly as much extra on sugar and coffee. 

> trade between rich and poor traps poor countries into exporting cheap sugar and coffee, and into always lagging behind the rich world.

## Way Out
> Prebisch said that they shouldn’t specialise, they should diversify – that is, make lots of different goods.

> They should close their borders to foreign cars and use it to build their own car factories.

**Another Sound**

In Chile the turn back towards capitalism was led by Chilean economists trained at Chicago, who, unlike Frank, had taken on their teachers’ message of free markets; they became known as the ‘Chicago Boys’. 

Saying that there is unfairness is one thing.It’s quite another to claim that this is an inescapable part of capitalism, as Frank does.

> The ‘Asian Tigers’ – South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan – transformed themselves from poor countries in the middle of the twentieth century to advanced industrial nations by the end of it.Trade with richer countries didn’t impoverish the Tigers: it was the lever for their development. Today, China is repeating the feat.
