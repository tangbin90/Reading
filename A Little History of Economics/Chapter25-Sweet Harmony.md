Who set the time table for economy?
## Partial Equilibrium
**Alfred Marshall** in the nineteenth century looked at supply and demand in a single market. The demand and supply for headphones depend on the price of headphones, those for oil on the price of oil.

Marshall’s theory of demand and supply is a theory of ‘partial equilibrium’: it ignored the *ripples*.

## General Equilibrium
**Leon Walras** (1834–1910)
The equilibrium of a single market can be written as a simple equation: supply = demand. In Walras’s theory, the supply and demand for oil depends on every price in the economy.

## Answer to All Equations
**American Kenneth Arrow** (b. 1921)
**French-born Gérard Debreu** (1921–2004)
> if there’s a general equilibrium in the economy then it must be pareto efficient.

### Pareto Efficient
**Vilfredo Pareto** (1848–1923)
> An economic outcome is undesirable or ‘inefficient’ if it’s possible to make at least one person better off without hurting anyone else.

> An economic outcome is ‘pareto efficient’ when all the swaps have been done. From that position it’s then impossible to make one person better off without making someone else worse off.

## Cons
One of pareto efficient results would be that in which one rich person owned everything and everyone else had nothing.

## Conclusion
Changes in one market cause changes in others. Economically speaking, everything is connected.
The theory depends on markets being competitive so that no buyer or seller can influence the price on their own.
