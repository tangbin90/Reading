**[[Physiocrats]]**重农主义
François Quesnay (1694–1774)

**net product**
it was what was left over from faming production after the farmers had taken what they needed.

## About Agriculture
> net product(surplus) was the life-force of the economy.

> It was unwise for a ruler to try to tamper with them, but that was exactly what the French monarchy had done, they said. It had bled the peasants dry and hobbled the country’s agriculture. Even worse, while the farmers were exploited, the state showered the craftsmen and merchants in the towns with privileges.

## Merchants and Craftsmen
Manufacturing industries were in fact completely incapable of creating a surplus. All they do is transform what nature has already created. Quesnay therefore called manufacturing a ‘[[Sterile]]’ activity 

## Model
The idea of model and the source of  hands-off economic policy.
> Quesnay made the first economic ‘model’, a simplified picture of the economy. Quesnay created it in his ingenious Tableau Economique (economic table). Quesnay was thoroughly modern in trying to find laws to describe the behaviour of the economy and in depicting them in models; today this is the method of economics.
