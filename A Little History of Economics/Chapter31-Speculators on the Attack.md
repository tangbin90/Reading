## Why Pegged Exchange Rate

## How to Set Up the Peg 
>It does this by buying and selling the currency to maintain its value.
>Economists call this stock a country’s ‘foreign currency reserves’; they’re crucial for regulating the level of exchange rate.

## Attack Pegs
>Because more pesos circulated for each dollar than before, the value of the peso in dollars looked set to fall. But a fall would break the peg. The government had to stop it by buying pesos using dollar reserves to keep constant the number of pesos in circulation. It worked for a while – until the government ran out of dollars.

>The fall happens before the dollars run out because of the actions of the currency speculators.

>Economists call it a currency crisis. The speculators gain because they’ve shifted their wealth into more valuable currencies like the dollar.
