## The Inequality
> society’s income distribution is ‘skewed”

Thomas Piketty (b. 1971) **Capital in the Twenty-First Century**

## How?
### Conventional Points
> * Karl Marx said that they’re the capitalists who exploit the workers to make money; 
* Joseph Schumpeter, that they’re bold people who take risks and get rich when they get lucky.

Economics says that workers are paid what they contribute to production. Educated people have skills that make them more productive, so they earn more. 

### Piketty: Historical Law of Capitalism
* Not productivity
> Piketty argues that top incomes are determined instead by companies’ habits and customs, and by what they’ve paid their top people in the past.

* Wealth
> houses and shares, and the businesses and land that they own. Income adds to wealth

* Wealth grows faster than economy(Wage)
Piketty summed it up with a formula that combined the rate of return on wealth, r, with the growth of the economy, g: r > g 

## Efficiency and Distribution
Redistribute will affect people's economic decision(why work hard if you lose some of your earnings in taxes).
> Redistribution leads to greater equality, but a slower growing economy.

## Solution
Anthony Atkinson (b. 1944)
* the First Welfare Theorem doesn’t hold in practice: markets don’t begin in a state of efficiency.
* A generous minimum wage could reduce inequality and improve efficiency

### Extreme Inequality
* Cause
After 1970s, Gov cut taxes in wealth
> After the global financial crisis the decline in economic growth made the difference between r and g even bigger, so inequality rose. 

* Solution
> Along with a minimum wage, he recommends the encouragement of technologies that promote equality.

With technology, people can get rid of large volume of boring daily works. And transfer into a more wage-friendly role.

> he proposes a global tax on the fortunes of the world’s richest people. 

But not likely to happen, cause the power and influence of hte world's tallest giants
