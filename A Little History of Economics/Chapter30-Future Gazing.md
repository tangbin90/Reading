**Rational Expectations and the Theory of Price Movements**
## Adaptive Expectations
> You predicted by looking at what happened up until now. 

## Rational Expectations
> Muth’s idea is simple to state. With rational expectations you’re no longer caught out. Instead of predicting your journey time on the basis of how long it took in the past, you use all the information available today, including the gas company’s announcement.

## Efficient Markets Hypothesis
Eugene Fama (b. 1939)
Prediction of movements in share prices never works.

>  The whole of the original expected price rise must get swallowed up in today’s price. If not, brokers would be missing out on a profit opportunity.
> If you think that something is going to happen to the price, then that must have already been taken into account in today’s price.
> The prices in financial markets reflect all available information.

## Another Nail
Rational expectations put another nail in the coffin of Keynesian economics.
Robert Lucas (b. 1937)
> They’re forming expectations by looking to the past. The government’s ability to boost the economy, even temporarily, depended on them getting fooled. When people have rational expectations that’s impossible.
> When thinking about whether to work more, they expect higher inflation in future. They understand that it means that their real wage won’t go up and so they don’t work more. 

## Opponents
Do markets really adjust so quickly? Are people really able to quickly gather and understand vast amounts of economic information?
