**Joseph Schumpeter(1883-1950)**
Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy

## Heroes
> the fruits of modern capitalism – the vast array of goods on offer and the new technologies used to produce them – are created by heroic figures

## About Depression
> Boom and bust, the up-and-down cycles of the capitalist economy, come from successive waves of innovation, the ebb and flow of entrepreneurship and imitation.

## About Monopolies
> Schumpeter believed that monopolies were especially important for bringing about innovation because they give entrepreneurs big rewards for the risky activity of trying to create new things. When an entrepreneur invents a new engine valve, they’re the only supplier of the valve: they’re a monopolist for it and so can earn high profits. (Apple Inc.)

## The End of Capitalism
> According to Schumpeter, the end of capitalism comes about because of the frustration of people at the top of society, the dissatisfied intellectuals.
