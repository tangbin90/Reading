**Thorstein Veblen(1857-1929)**
**The Theory of the Leisure Class**

## Conventional Theory
> The economy was full of ‘rational economic men’, sensible people who accurately weighed the cost and benefit of any economic decision and then acted accordingly.

## Veblen's Opinion
> People don’t make decisions about what to buy and how to spend their time through rational calculation. To really understand people’s choices you have to look to their instincts and habits, things shaped by the societies they grew up in.

T-shirt that you bought: even if you bought it because you liked it, didn’t you also think about whether your friends would like it too?

## Leisure Class and Conspicuous Consumption
> The new rich lived off the interest from shares and inherited fortunes without having to do very much. He named the privileged few the ‘leisure class’.

> Conspicuous consumption is a waste, said Veblen. It diverts economic energy from the production of what people really need into what they can show off with.

> He thought that the waste caused by conspicuous consumption would be done away with when society was ruled by the instinct of workmanship rather than predation(/prɪˈdeɪ.ʃən/ the fact that an animal hunts, kills, and eats other animals:社会达尔文主义).

## End
Veblen didn’t quite live to see it(The Great Depression), dying a few months before the storm hit, living to the last as the hermit(/ˈhɝː.mɪt/) that he really was, among the rats and skunks(/skʌŋk/) that kept him company in his hut.
