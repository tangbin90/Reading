Why we need tariff.
## The Ridiculous Requirements
>The candle makers ask parliament to pass a law requiring the closing of all windows and curtains and the blocking up of any holes that let in sunlight. The law would save the candle factories and help to make France rich

## View of Free Trade by [Recardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo)
> Free trade means that goods are treated the same wherever they happen to be from.

>Countries should specialise in the production of the goods that they can make relatively cheaply and then trade with other countries, he said. All countries then gain.

## Views by Georg Friedrich List
[Georg Friedrich List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_List) (1789–1846)
_National System of Political Economy_
Influenced by American Founding Fathers
>Foreign countries tried to help their own industries by making it hard for American companies to sell their goods in their lands, and Hamilton thought that America should do the same for its own industries. Ricardo’s idea of free trade simply wasn’t the answer for America.

>List said that it was wrong to think of trade between countries as the same as that between individuals because different nations are more than groups of people with different passports. Countries have their own histories, cultures and ways of governing themselves. They’re all at different stages: some are advanced industrial societies, some still mainly agricultural.

>He believed that economic progress was about creating an economy based on industries and factories rather than farms. But early on, new industries are like children. As a child, you’re nurtured and cared for. Free trade was beneficial between countries or regions that were at the same stage of development

## Opposition
>They believe that protection rewards incompetence and waste. Competition between firms is useful because businesses that make low-quality products go bust. Their workforces and buildings can then be used by other people to make better products. Protection, economists fear, stops that from happening because it helps inefficient firms to stay in business.

## Basic Method of Economics
>List said that economics had to start with facts and history. Armed with this sort of information you might be able to draw conclusions about how an economy worked and what policies should be used to develop it. 

> The other way of doing economics was to use abstract reasoning as David Ricardo did. He started with basic principles and reasoned towards a conclusion.

>In the end it became clear that both sides had a point. Theories need to be tested against historical experience. To this day, critics of economics complain that the subject has become rather removed from reality, that it’s turned into a mathematical game rather than the study of actual facts about the economy, facts that affect real people’s lives.
