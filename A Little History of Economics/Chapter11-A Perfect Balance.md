>But as you eat more [[Toffees]] the pleasure you get from an extra one won’t be as great. The tenth toffee is nice, but not as nice as the first.

## Why Champagne Valuable
>Adam Smith and Karl Marx thought that value came from the costs of producing something, especially in the labour that went into making it.

Another reason:
>It’s valuable because people like it a lot. Champagne gives them a great amount of satisfaction or happiness.

## Marginal Utility
**[William Jevons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Jevons) (1835–82)**
> The pleasure from an extra toffee is its marginal utility. ‘Margin’ means the edge of something, so the ‘edge’ of your utility from toffees is the utility of the very last one you ate. The tendency of marginal utility to go down as you consume more is known as the ‘principle of diminishing marginal utility’.

**Alfred Marshall (1842–1924)**
>Marshall combined the consumer and the firm in the theory of supply and demand, one of the most famous ideas in economics. A ‘demand curve’ links price with the quantity that people want.
