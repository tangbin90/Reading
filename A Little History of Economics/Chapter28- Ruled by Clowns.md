Writings shattered the image of the virtuous politician
shatter /ˈʃæt.ər/
broken into very small pieces:
virtuous  /ˈvɜː.tʃu.əs/
having good moral qualities and behavior:

**Abraham Lincoln**
government of the people, by the people, for the people

**Charlie Chaplin**
I remain just one thing, and one thing only, and that is a clown. It places me on a far higher plane than any politician.

**James Buchanan (1919–2013)**
> Buchanan believed that politicians’ claims to be working for the good of society, like Big Bill’s, were just a large puff of hot air.

## Role of Government
Redistributing wealth by taxing the rich and giving money to the poor, and by supplying health care and schooling
After the war, many governments started taking on these tasks, spending more money in the economy and getting bigger than ever before. 

## Public Choice
> He described it as ‘politics without romance’. Politicians weren’t unselfish heroes – to Buchanan that was a silly, romantic notion. In reality they were more interested in protecting their positions, and were quite a bit grubbier, more selfish and unreliable, than economists had believed them to be.
> The growth of government was more to do with politicians and bureaucrats looking out for themselves than with helping markets to work better

### Rent Seeking
> The prospect of earning extra profits for doing very little encourages ‘rent-seeking’. Businesses spend money trying to persuade the government to give them privileges.
> Rent-seeking hurts consumers because if the markets for cars and umbrellas are protected from foreign competition then people have fewer cars and umbrellas to choose from.

### How To Prevent
Agree with the broad ‘rules of the game’ that everyone agrees to and that particular governments or politicians can’t easily change. One of them, for example, is that people should be allowed to express their opinions without being thrown into jail. Some of these sorts of rules are contained in documents like the American constitution

## Opponents
People are more than greedy animals.
