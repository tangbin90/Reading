## Cost and Benefits Matter
‘The Economic Way of Looking at Life’Becker thought that economics could be used to understand pretty much any area of life.

## Opportunity cost
### Crime

A high fine with a low chance of being caught can come to the same thing as a small fine with a high chance of being caught. The best way to get rid of crime is to make it unprofitable. For illegal parking that might mean a higher fine, for burglary a longer prison sentence.

### Time

For someone on a high wage the opportunity cost of watching the Star Wars films is high because in spending the day watching them instead of working they give up a lot of money.

### Children
 Often the earnings that are given up are those of women when they stop working to look after their children, so during the twentieth century, as more women went out to work, the cost of children rose. The result was that women began to have fewer of them.

### Education
Today, the notion that students go to university to gain skills that will help them get high-paying jobs when they graduate is barely questioned.
