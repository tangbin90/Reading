>Population will quickly [[Outstrip]] food supply. There’ll soon be too many mouths [[Gobbling]] up too little food.

>They had to eat scraps and trudge through mud for hours to get anywhere. 

>Over the nineteenth century something else happened which neither Malthus nor the prophets of progress foresaw.

**Thomas Malthus(1766-1834)**  
The first ever professor of economics, appointed in 1805 to the East India College.

_An Essay on the principle of population, as it affects the future improvement of society with remarks on the speculations of Mr. Godwin, M. Condorcet, and other writers_

## Population
### Mercantilists
> They believed that large populations helped nations to win out over foreign rivals because a large labour force working for low wages allowed manufacturers to make cheap goods to sell abroad, and a large army and navy made possible the defense of the nations’ trade routes”

### Utopian thinkers
> People weren’t doomed to poverty. They believed above all in progress. If people helped each other, poverty and squalor could be abolished

### Malthus
>Malthus feared an ever-growing population: more people meant more poverty, he claimed. All that a growing population would do was to condemn more and more people to a [[Wretched]] existence.

Two starting points
>First, humans need food to survive. Second, they must have sex in order to reproduce. What’s more, they like having sex and will keep doing it.

>Malthus was spelling out with [[Grim]] clarity the constraints facing people living in those early societies.



### Opposition
>Many economists who today study the growth of economies over the long term think that large populations go with healthy economies. People use up resources, but they also create new ones: more people mean more brains, and so more new ideas about how to produce society’s wealth.
