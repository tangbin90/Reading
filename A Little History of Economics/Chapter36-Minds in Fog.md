## Behavioural Economics
> All economics is about behavior, of course, but behavioral economics was new because it built its theories around the quirks in people’s actual decision-making, rather than simply assuming that they were completely rational.

## Quirk in Decision-making
### Loss Aversion
> When they already had one they valued mugs more highly than when they didn’t.

> Once you have something it becomes more valuable to you.

> Reference points stop people making decisions rationally on the basis of absolute money outcomes. If a laptop on sale for $1,000 looks like a so-so deal, the same one discounted to $1,000 from $1,500 might look like a bargain. 

### Judge Uncertainty
People tends to believe description with more details. But more details mean less probability.

## Behavioural Economics and Financial Markets
Robert Shiller (b. 1946)
>The market was being lifted up by overexcited investors and soon it would thud to the ground. Conventional economics think that share prices reflect all the available economic information. Rationality ensures that financial markets work efficiently(the efficient markets hypothesis). Share prices were more unstable than the hypothesis implied because they went up and down more than firms’ profits did.

## END
**Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds**
Shiller predicted it – this time it was houses. People scrambled to take out loans to buy houses as prices went up and up. And as we’ll see later, when the bubble burst, the whole financial system was nearly destroyed.
