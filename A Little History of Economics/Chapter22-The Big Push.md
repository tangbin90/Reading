Arthur Lewis & Paul Rosenstein-Rodan(1915 - 91)
**development economics**
Development suggests advancement and improvement: a baby becomes a toddler, learns how to communicate and eventually turns into a socially sophisticated adult. 

Crucially, they believed that there were policies that could make the 'underdeveloped' countries richer.

## Lewis
Lewis showed how developing economies needed to take the plentiful labour in the countryside and to place it in factories, but Rosenstein-Rodan said that this wouldn’t happen automatically.

## Rodan
Developing countries had to go from having nothing to having everything, and Rosenstein-Rodan argued that only the government could time the leap accurately. It had to make massive investments in many areas of the economy. He called it the ‘big push'.

## Consequence
In Ghana it did give people hospitals, telephones and clean water, but it also created lots of inefficient firms. 

Politics and economics became linked in a way that hurt development. As the government put money into the new industries, businesspeople would do everything to make sure that it kept coming. 

In South Korea, Park organised South Korea’s push through chaebols, large businesses with close links to the government. The government directed the chaebols into particular industries and gave them cheap loans. At first they were protected from foreign competition, but the government insisted that they become competitive and eventually export their goods
